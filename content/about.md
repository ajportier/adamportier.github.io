My name is Adam Portier. I currently work as a Systems Administrator in higher education, with a focus on Linux systems.

I have degrees from St. Mary's College of Maryland (Bachelor of Arts, Computer Science) and Villanova University (Master of Science, Computer Science).

I have been working with computers my entire life, starting with programming and system configuration when I was in middle school and eventually making a career out of it.

I am an open source advocate and have been a proud Linux user since 2002. My preferred Linux environment is Ubuntu. My primary language of choice is Python, but I have experience with Perl, Bash and Java.

Outside of work, my primary hobby is video games, mostly on PC. I love music, mostly heavy metal and some electronic music.
