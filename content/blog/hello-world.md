Hello World. Here is the latest attempt at me making a homepage, a place for my thoughts on the Internet.

This space will serve primarily as a place to provide contact information and the occasional thought I deem worthy of shouting into the void.

I have chosen [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) for this latest iteration of my homepage. I am hosting the output on Github pages. Long, long ago this would have been on Blogspot, which shows my age somewhat.

What to expect here? Every once in a while, when I do something I think worthy of sharing, I will do so here. My primary interests are technology (mostly open source), music (heavy metal) and video games (all kinds). I make no promises to the frequency or quality of these posts.

I am still setting up this new homepage, and when I am done my next post will probably be some details about what all I did to get it working.
